	abstract = {This paper describes a hierarchical stochastic simulation
                  algorithm which has been implemented within iBioSim, a tool
                  used to model, analyze, and visualize genetic circuits. Many
                  biological analysis tools flatten out hierarchy before
                  simulation, but there are many disadvantages associated with
                  this approach. First, the memory required to represent the
                  model can quickly expand in the process. Second, the
                  flattening process is computationally expensive. Finally, when
                  modeling a dynamic cellular population within iBioSim,
                  inlining the hierarchy of the model is inefficient since
                  models must grow dynamically over time. This paper discusses a
                  new approach to handle hierarchy on the fly to make the tool
                  faster and more memory-efficient. This approach yields
                  significant performance improvements as compared to the former
                  flat analysis method.},

	abstract = {Simulation of biomolecular networks is now indispensable for
                  studying biological systems, from small reaction networks to
                  large ensembles of cells. Here we present a novel approach for
                  stochastic simulation of networks embedded in the dynamic
                  environment of the cell and its surroundings. We thus sample
                  trajectories of the stochastic process described by the
                  chemical master equation with time-varying propensities. A
                  comparative analysis shows that existing approaches can either
                  fail dramatically, or else can impose impractical
                  computational burdens due to numerical integration of reaction
                  propensities, especially when cell ensembles are studied. Here
                  we introduce the Extrande method which, given a simulated time
                  course of dynamic network inputs, provides a conditionally
                  exact and several orders-of-magnitude faster simulation
                  solution. The new approach makes it feasible to
                  demonstrate—using decision-making by a large population of
                  quorum sensing bacteria—that robustness to fluctuations from
                  upstream signaling places strong constraints on the design of
                  networks determining cell fate. Our approach has the potential
                  to significantly advance both understanding of molecular
                  systems biology and design of synthetic circuits.},

	abstract = {A reaction network is a chemical system involving multiple
                  reactions and chemical species. The simplest stochastic models
                  of such networks treat the system as a continuous time Markov
                  chain with the state being the number of molecules of each
                  species and with reactions modeled as possible transitions of
                  the chain. This chapter is devoted to the mathematical study
                  of such stochastic models. We begin by developing much of the
                  mathematical machinery we need to describe the stochastic
                  models we are most interested in. We show how one can
                  represent counting processes of the type we need in terms of
                  Poisson processes. This random time-change representation
                  gives a stochastic equation for continuous-time Markov chain
                  models. We include a discussion on the relationship between
                  this stochastic equation and the corresponding martingale
                  problem and Kolmogorov forward (master) equation. Next, we
                  exploit the representation of the stochastic equation for
                  chemical reaction networks and, under what we will refer to as
                  the classical scaling, show how to derive the deterministic
                  law of mass action from the Markov chain model. We also review
                  the diffusion, or Langevin, approximation, include a
                  discussion of first order reaction networks, and present a
                  large class of networks, those that are weakly reversible and
                  have a deficiency of zero, that induce product-form stationary
                  distributions. Finally, we discuss models in which the numbers
                  of molecules and/or the reaction rate constants of the system
                  vary over several orders of magnitude. We show that one
                  consequence of this wide variation in scales is that different
                  subsystems may evolve on different time scales and this
                  time-scale variation can be exploited to identify reduced
                  models that capture the behavior of parts of the system. We
                  will discuss systematic ways of identifying the different time
                  scales and deriving the reduced models.},

	abstract = {Rule-based modelling is particularly effective for handling
                  the highly combinatorial aspects of cellular signalling. The
                  dynamics is described in terms of interactions between partial
                  complexes, and the ability to write rules with such partial
                  complexes -i.e., not to have to specify all the traits of the
                  entitities partaking in a reaction but just those that matter-
                  is the key to obtaining compact descriptions of what otherwise
                  could be nearly infinite dimensional dynamical systems. This
                  also makes these descriptions easier to read, write and
                  modify.In the course of modelling a particular signalling
                  system it will often happen that more traits matter in a given
                  interaction than previously thought, and one will need to
                  strengthen the conditions under which that interaction may
                  happen. This is a process that we call rule refinement and
                  which we set out in this paper to study. Specifically we
                  present a method to refine rule sets in a way that preserves
                  the implied stochastic semantics.This stochastic semantics is
                  dictated by the number of different ways in which a given rule
                  can be applied to a system (obeying the mass action
                  principle). The refinement formula we obtain explains how to
                  refine rules and which choice of refined rates will lead to a
                  neutral refinement, i.e., one that has the same global
                  activity as the original rule had (and therefore leaves the
                  dynamics unchanged). It has a pleasing mathematical
                  simplicity, and is reusable with little modification across
                  many variants of stochastic graph rewriting. A particular case
                  of the above is the derivation of a maximal refinement which
                  is equivalent to a (possibly infinite) Petri net and can be
                  useful to get a quick approximation of the dynamics and to
                  calibrate models. As we show with examples, refinement is also
                  useful to understand how different subpopulations contribute
                  to the activity of a rule, and to modulate differentially
                  their impact on that activity.},
