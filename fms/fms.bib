	abstract = {Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. is used as a model plant in
                  many research projects. However, few models simulate its
                  growth at the whole-plant scale. The present study describes
                  the first model of Arabidopsis growth integrating
                  organogenesis, morphogenesis and carbon-partitioning processes
                  for aerial and subterranean parts of the plant throughout its
                  development. The objective was to analyse competition among
                  sinks as they emerge from patterns of plant structural
                  development. The model was adapted from the GreenLab model and
                  was used to estimate organ sink strengths by optimisation
                  against biomass measurements. Dry biomass production was
                  calculated by a radiation use efficiency-based
                  approach. Organogenesis processes were parameterised based on
                  experimental data. The potential of this model for growth
                  analysis was assessed using the Columbia ecotype, which was
                  grown in standard environmental conditions. Three phases were
                  observed in the overall time course of trophic competition
                  within the plant. In the vegetative phase, no competition was
                  observed. In the reproductive phase, competition increased
                  with a strong increase when lateral inflorescences
                  developed. Roots and internodes and structures bearing
                  siliques were strong sinks and had a similar impact on
                  competition. The application of the GreenLab model to the
                  growth analysis of A. thaliana provides new insights into
                  source–sink relationships as functions of phenology and

                  this hypothesis with an experimentally based mechanistic model
                  in Arabidopsis thaliana. * • Experiments were conducted on
                  wild-type (WT) A. thaliana, starch-excess (sex1) and
                  starchless (pgm) mutants under ambient and elevated CO2
                  conditions to determine parameters and validate the model. * •
                  The model correctly predicted that mutant growth is
                  approx. 20\% of that in WT, and the absolute response of both
                  mutants to elevated CO2 is an order of magnitude lower than in
                  WT. For sex1, direct starch unavailability explained the
                  growth responses. For pgm, we demonstrated experimentally that
                  maintenance respiration is proportional to leaf soluble sugar

                  evolution. It extends evolutionary game theory to account for
                  more realistic ecological dynamics and it can incorporate both
                  frequency- and density-dependent selection. This is a
                  practical guide to adaptive dynamics that aims to illustrate
                  how the methodology can be applied to the study of specific
                  systems. The theory is presented in detail for a single,
                  monomorphic, asexually reproducing population. We explain the
                  necessary terminology to understand the basic arguments in
                  models based on adaptive dynamics, including invasion fitness,
                  the selection gradient, pairwise invasibility plots (PIP),
                  evolutionarily singular strategies, and the canonical
                  equation. The presentation is supported with a worked-out
                  example of evolution of arrival times in migratory birds. We
                  show how the adaptive dynamics methodology can be extended to
                  study evolution in polymorphic populations using trait
                  evolution plots (TEPs). We give an overview of literature that
                  generalises adaptive dynamics techniques to other scenarios,
                  such as sexual, diploid populations, and spatially-structured
                  populations. We conclude by discussing how adaptive dynamics

                  continually interact with the rest of the cell. In microbes,
                  for example, we now know that gene expression across the whole
                  genome typically changes with growth rate. The mechanisms
                  driving such global regulation, however, are not well
                  understood. Here we consider three trade-offs that, because of
                  limitations in levels of cellular energy, free ribosomes, and
                  proteins, are faced by all living cells and we construct a
                  mechanistic model that comprises these trade-offs. Our model
                  couples gene expression with growth rate and growth rate with
                  a growing population of cells. We show that the model recovers
                  Monod’s law for the growth of microbes and two other empirical
                  relationships connecting growth rate to the mass fraction of
                  ribosomes. Further, we can explain growth-related effects in
                  dosage compensation by paralogs and predict host–circuit
                  interactions in synthetic biology. Simulating competitions
                  between strains, we find that the regulation of metabolic
                  pathways may have evolved not to match expression of enzymes
                  to levels of extracellular substrates in changing environments
                  but rather to balance a trade-off between exploiting one type
                  of nutrient over another. Although coarse-grained, the
                  trade-offs that the model embodies are fundamental, and, as

                  environmental conditions to which each life stage is exposed
                  and the length of time required to complete a generation. Both
                  environmental and genetic factors contribute to phenological
                  variation, yet predicting their combined effect on life cycles
                  across a geographic range remains a challenge. We linked
                  submodels of the plasticity of individual life stages to
                  create an integrated model that predicts life-cycle phenology
                  in complex environments. We parameterized the model for
                  Arabidopsis thaliana and simulated life cycles in four
                  locations. We compared multiple “genotypes” by varying two
                  parameters associated with natural genetic variation in
                  phenology: seed dormancy and floral repression. The model
                  predicted variation in life cycles across locations that

                  dormancy had larger effects on life-cycle length than floral
                  repression, and results suggest that a genetic cline in
                  dormancy maintains a life-cycle length of 1 year across the
                  geographic range of this species. By integrating across life
                  stages, this approach demonstrates how genetic variation in
                  one transition can influence subsequent transitions and the

	abstract = {Despite the numerous studies which have been conducted
                  during the past decade on species ranges and their
                  relationship to the environment, our understanding of how
                  environmental conditions shape species distribution is still
                  far from complete. Yet, some process-based species
                  distribution models have been able to simulate plants and
                  insects distribution at a global scale. These models strongly
                  rely on the completion of the annual cycle of the species and
                  therefore on their accomplished phenology. In particular, they
                  have shown that the northern limit of species' ranges appears
                  to be caused mainly by the inability to undergo full fruit
                  maturation, while the southern limit appears to be caused by
                  the inability to flower or unfold leaves owing to a lack of
                  chilling temperatures that are necessary to break bud
                  dormancy. I discuss here why phenology is a key adaptive trait
                  in shaping species distribution using mostly examples from
                  plant species, which have been the most documented. After
                  discussing how phenology is involved in fitness and why it is
                  an adaptive trait susceptible to evolve quickly in changing
                  climate conditions, I describe how phenology is related to
                  fitness in species distribution process-based models and
                  discuss the fate of species under climate change scenarios
                  using model projections and experimental or field studies from
                  the literature.},

                  experimental technologies. Its development as a scientific
                  discipline will be enhanced by systems biology, which
                  generates novel, quantitative hypotheses via
                  modelling. However, in order to better assist crop
                  improvement, the impact of developing functional genomics
                  needs to be assessed at the crop level, given a projected
                  diminishing effect of genetic alteration on phenotypes from
                  the molecule to crop levels. This review illustrates a
                  recently proposed research field, crop systems biology, which
                  is located at the crossroads of crop physiology and functional
                  genomics, and intends to promote communications between the
                  two. Past experiences with modelling whole-crop physiology
                  indicate that the layered structure of biological systems
                  should be taken into account. Moreover, modelling not only
                  plays a role in data synthesis and quantitative prediction,
                  but certainly also in heuristics and system design. These
                  roles of modelling can be applied to crop systems biology to
                  enhance its contribution to our understanding of complex crop
                  phenotypes and subsequently to crop improvement. The success
                  of crop systems biology needs commitments from scientists
                  along the entire knowledge chain of plant biology, from
                  molecule or gene to crop and agro-ecosystem.},

                  modelling from largely isolated efforts to a connected
                  community endeavour that can take full advantage of advances
                  in computer science and in mechanistic understanding of plant
                  processes. Plants in silico (Psi) envisions a digital
                  representation of layered dynamic modules, linking from gene
                  networks and metabolic pathways through to cellular
                  organization, tissue, organ and whole plant development,
                  together with resource capture and use efficiency in dynamic
                  competitive environments, ultimately allowing a
                  mechanistically rich simulation of the plant or of a community
                  of plants in silico. The concept is to integrate models or
                  modules from different layers of organization spanning from
                  genome to phenome to ecosystem in a modular framework allowing
                  the use of modules of varying mechanistic detail representing
                  the same biological process. Developments in high-performance
                  computing, functional knowledge of plants, the internet and
                  open-source version controlled software make achieving the
                  concept realistic. Open source will enhance collaboration and
                  move towards testing and consensus on quantitative theoretical
                  frameworks. Importantly, Psi provides a quantitative knowledge
                  framework where the implications of a discovery at one level,
                  for example, single gene function or developmental response,
                  can be examined at the whole plant or even crop and natural

	abstract = {Extensive natural variation has been described for the
                  timing of flowering initiation in many annual plants including
                  the model wild species Arabidopsis thaliana, which is presumed
                  to be involved in adaptation to different climates. However,
                  the environmental factors that might shape this genetic
                  variation, as well as the molecular bases of climatic
                  adaptation by modifications of flowering time remain mostly
                  unknown. To approach both goals, we characterized the
                  flowering behavior in relation to vernalization of 182
                  A. thaliana wild genotypes collected in a native region
                  spanning a broad climatic range. Phenotype-environment
                  association analyses identified strong altitudinal clines
                  (0-2600 m) in seven out of nine flowering related
                  traits. Altitudinal clines were dissected in terms of minimum
                  winter temperature and precipitation indicating that these are
                  the main climatic factors that might act as selective
                  pressures on flowering traits. In addition, we used an
                  association analysis approach with four candidate genes, FRI,
                  FLC, PhyC and CRY2, to decipher the genetic bases of this
                  variation. Eleven different loss-of-function FRI alleles of
                  low frequency accounted for up to 16\% of the variation for
                  most traits. Furthermore, an FLC allelic series of six novel
                  putative loss- and change-of-function alleles, with low to
                  moderate frequency, revealed that a broader FLC functional
                  diversification might contribute to flowering
                  variation. Finally, environment-genotype association analyses
                  showed that the spatial patterns of FRI, FLC and PhyC
                  polymorphisms are significantly associated with winter
                  temperatures and spring and winter precipitations,
                  respectively. These results support that allelic variation in
                  these genes is involved in climatic adaptation.},

	abstract = {Reproductive phase change in Arabidopsis thaliana is
                  characterized by the floral transition (initiation of the
                  first flower) and the bolting transition (elongation of the
                  first internode). Here, the relationship between these
                  transitions is examined by comparing variation in cauline and
                  total leaf numbers in wild-type plants and 49 early-flowering
                  mutants under a wide range of photoperiods. The timing of
                  these transitions was also evaluated by subjecting wild-type
                  plants to photoperiodic perturbations at different
                  developmental stages. Coupling between the bolting and floral
                  transitions was altered in the wild type under non-optimal
                  flowering conditions but could be restored by optimal
                  conditions that activate the progression to flowering,
                  including continuous light treatments and early flowering
                  mutations. Under non-optimal photoperiodic conditions, the
                  floral node was specified a few days before the bolting
                  node. Altered definitions of long days for the cauline and
                  total leaf responses were frequently coupled in early
                  flowering mutants and were associated with similar
                  photomorphogenetic defects. By contrast, altered definitions
                  of short days were often opposite for the two leaf responses
                  and were associated with different photomorphogenetic and
                  circadian phenotypes. It is concluded that the bolting and
                  floral transitions are regulated by different signalling
                  pathways under non-optimal conditions and that phase change is
                  a multidimensional process. This paper also proposes that, in
                  contrast to the floral transition which is contingent on
                  different factors, the bolting transition may be a robust
                  indicator of reproductive phase change, especially when the
                  progression to flowering is not optimal.},
