\chapter{Optimal Control}
\label{chp:oc}

Biological dynamics, from single cell behaviours to emergent properties of
populations, are the result of the complex interplay between genomes and the
environment. Efforts to tightly regulate them have so far largely been focused
on (re)engineering genomes. In this work we instead address the problem of
controlling the plant biomass manipulating the environment around it. While the
automatic climate control problem has been studied before for greenhouses, the
focus of such efforts was on the minimisation of energy consumption and/or
achieving assigned climate regimes. Seldom those works attempted to optimise
crop traits \citep{Chalabi1996, udinktenCate1983, Challa_1990, Aaslyng2003}.

More insulated and sophisticated growth environments with more precise control
are becoming available as part of the urban and controlled-environment
agriculture movement \citep{mok_strawberry_2014, despommier_farming_2013}. There
are many commercial examples (\href{https://aerofarms.com/}{Aerofarms},
\href{https://motorleaf.com/}{Motorleaf}) and others like Intelligent Growth
Solutions (\href{https://www.intelligentgrowthsolutions.com/}{IGS}) that are
based on novel technologies, for example, for reducing energy consumption and
increasing control over the growth space (lighting patent
\cite{aykroyd_novel_2016}, automated growth tower patent
\cite{aykroyd_automated_2018}). These more sophisticated growth environment
allow us to focus more on crop traits and even more precisely at specific
quality standards (size, uniformity) that crops need to meet \citep[see for
example EU marketing standards on fruit and vegetables;][]{eu-543-2011}.

In this chapter, we present a formulation of the climate control problem for
\textit{Arabidopsis thaliana} plants as an optimal control problem
\citep{kirk_optimal_2012} where the control variables are climate conditions
(temperature) and the performance criterion is a crop trait. It has already been
proposed that more mechanistic models are needed when linking between multiple
scales instead of the usually empirical models used in crop modelling
\citep{yin_role_2004, yin_modelling_2010}. Here we use the Framework Model
\citep[FMv1;][]{chew2014multiscale} as a mathematical description of vegetative
plant growth of \textit{Arabidopsis thaliana} that provides mechanistic links
from molecular regulation all the way to whole-plant traits, like biomass. In
particular, our contributions in this work are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Formulation and solution of a \textit{direct problem} of offline climate
  control where the control variable is the temperature of a growth chamber in
  order to achieve a particular plant biomass at a particular time (predicted
  from the FM). The solution to the problem uses standard gradient-based
  optimisation techniques by discretising the growth period and assuming
  constant temperature within each time interval.
\item Formulation and solution of an \textit{indirect problem} of offline
  climate control. Here we assume that we cannot control temperature precisely
  in the growth space, which leads to temperature inhomogeneities. We further
  assume that we can control the position of plants (e.g. switch their
  positions) in a linear array that has a temperature gradient. The control
  variable is the position of the plants and the performance criterion is
  homogeneity in final plant biomass (as predicted from the FM) for the
  population of plants in the array. For the solution of the problem we use
  techniques from combinatorial optimisation since the control variables are
  discrete.
\end{itemize}

\section{The model and main idea}
For this work we use the Framework Model (FM) as described in
\citet{chew2014multiscale}. The FM takes environmental inputs (CO2 level,
temperature, light intensity, and temperature) and outputs several
growth-related quantities over its simulation time. In the following work,
however, we will treat the FM model a Single Input Single Output system
accepting temperature as input and outputting biomass by regarding all the other
inputs as constant and ignoring the rest of the output signals. Despite the
``black box'' approach we take to model plant growth, it is instructive to look
at two particular metabolic processes that are highly temperature dependent.

\begin{figure}[tb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/fmFig/agentFlows.eps}
\caption{Metabolic processes as flows in the Framework Model (FM). A The FM
  keeps track of carbon movement in different pools, one for each organ (leaves
  and root) and two whole-plant reserves of sucrose carbon (c) and starch carbon
  (s). Maintenance respiration and assimilation (intake of carbon) are
  explicitly temperature dependent (indicated by red dots) B Photosynthesis and
  maintenance rate trends for a range of temperature values.}
\label{fig:fm}
\end{figure}

All the metabolic processes keep track of the main building block of new mass,
carbon, and are represented as flows between various pools representing the
organs (root and leaves only at the vegetative stage) and whole plant reserves
of carbon as sucrose (C) and starch (S) (Figure~\ref{fig:fm}A). The two
metabolic processes that are temperature dependent are (i) assimilation, the
intake of carbon from the environment represented as an in-flow into the central
reservoir of sucrose carbon (C) and (ii) maintenance respiration, the use of
carbon for maintaining the life-sustaining processes inside the plant
represented as an out-flow from the main sucrose carbon
reservoir. Figure~\ref{fig:fm}B shows the rates of these flows for a range of
temperature while keeping the other environmental inputs constant (light
intensity,120 $\mu \mathrm{mol} \cdot m^{-2} \cdot s^{-1}$, CO2=420ppm).

While temperature directly affects only two of the processes it also indirectly
affects the other since all of them compete for the sucrose carbon in the main
reservoir. Therefore and not surprisingly temperature is a major determinant of
growth rate and final biomass. The \emph{main idea} of this work is to control
temperature and therefore indirectly control growth to achieve a particular
growth-related objective of interest using the FM as our ground truth to
evaluate the growth of an \textit{Arabidopsis thaliana} plant at different
temperature inputs.

In the FM the growing plants starts as seeds and wait for a period of time
(emergence period), which is a function of temperature, before they emerge and
start vegetative growth. In the following we only control temperature in the
vegetative growth phase and not in the emergence period. Therefore we assume
that seeds are kept in a constant temperature of 22\textdegree C during the
emergence period.


\section{Direct problem}
Here we seek to design a control scheme that modulates temperature to reach a
specific biomass after a particular period of time. This is relevant to growers,
for example, that have specific requirements both in terms of time and crop
attributes.

Given the characteristic of the problem at hand we formulate is as an optimal
control problem, i.e. find a time-profile of temperature function, $T^*(t)$,
over a period $[t_0, t_f]$ that minimises the difference between the final
biomass of the plant (as predicted by the FM) and a target biomass $m_0$:
$$
J = m_{T^*}(t_f) - m_0
$$
where $m_{T*}(t)$ is the temperature dependent biomass trajectory predicted from
the FM. To reflect physical constraings, we impose upper and lower bounds on the
temperature $T_l < T(t) < T_u$. Additionally, here we consider the case of a
``single plant control''. Notably, this approach can be extended, with
appropriate modifications, to the control of crops.

\begin{figure}[tb]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{figures/directPFig/ocProb}
\caption{Direct problem of climate control. For the \emph{direct problem} we try
  to find a temperature function or sequence of temperature values in the
  optimisation formulation in order for the final biomass value as predicted by
  the FM (using this temperature function as input) to reach a specific
  predefined value, $m_0$.}
\label{fig:directP}
\end{figure}

As conventional in optimal control, we can convert the optimal control into a
standard non-linear optimisation problem by discretising the time domain
$[t_0, t_f]$ into $k$ intervals and assuming a constant temperature value inside
each interval \citep{kraft_converting_1985}.
\begin{definition}[biomass-only problem]
The \emph{biomass-only problem} is the problem of finding a sequence of
temperature values, $T_{1, k}=T_1, \dots, T_k$, that minimises the square of the
% why did we choose the square of the difference if we are considering a single point?
difference between the final biomass value of the plant at $t_f$,
$m_{T_{1, k}}(t_f)$, as predicted by the FM, for the sequence $T_{1, k}$.
\begin{align*}
& \argmin_{T_1, \dots T_k} \; (m_{T_{1, k}}(t_f) - m_0)^2 \; \; \text{subject to} \\
& T_l < T_{i} < T_u; \; \; \; i=1 \dots k
\end{align*}
\end{definition}
Note that we use $T_{i, k}$ and $T_1, \dots, T_k$ interchangeably for a sequence of
$k$ temperature values.

Since repeated, large switchings of the temperature introduce wear and tear of
the actuators and use energy, we extend our control problem to take into account
the control effort as well.

\begin{definition}[biomass+control effort problem]
  The \emph{biomass+control effort} problem is an extension to the
  \emph{biomass-only problem} where the sought sequence of temperatures
  $T_{1, k}=T_1, \dots, T_k$ minimises both the distance to the target biomass,
  $m_0$, and the control effort defined as the average jump between successive
  temperatures in the sequence, $\underline{T}$.
$$ \argmin_{T_1, \dots T_k} \; (m_{T_{1, k}}(t_f) - m_0)^2 \; + \; \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=2}^{k} T_i - T_{(i-1)}$$
\end{definition}
% what about multi-objective optimisation instead of single-objective with
% linear combination of two?
The bound constraints are the simple lower/upper bounds as before. 

\subsection{Results}
In this section we solve the two formulations of the optimisation problems
(direct problem) using the \texttt{fmincon} function for constrained non-linear
optimisation from the Matlab optimisation toolbox for some choices of $m_0$,
$t_f$, and $k$. While we vary $m_0$ to explore different instances of the
problem, we generally leave $t_f$ and $k$ constant ($t_f=512h$, $k=4$). There
are methods that adapt $k$ that we could have used that are implemented in more
sophisticated tools \citep[mesh refinement, AMIGO
tool;][]{balsa-canto_amigo2_2016}). The final time is dictated by the bolting
time of the plant under the range of temperatures that we consider since the FM
only considers vegetative growth (before bolting). Bolting time is more than
$512h$ for all the temperature values in the range that we consider
($[10, 30]$).

We use a performance metric, $\mathrm{log}(\sqrt{L(T_{1, k}, t_f, m_0)} / m_0)$,
to assess particular optimisations for different problem instances (specific
$k$, $t_f$, and $m_0$) that states the final value of the biomass objective
function $L(T_{1, k}, t_f, m_0))=(m_{T_{1, k}}(t_f) - m_0)^2$ as a percentage of
the target biomass.

\begin{definition}[$\epsilon$-reachable]
  A target biomass value,$m_0$, defining a particular instance of the
  biomass-only or biomass+control effort problems is $\epsilon$-\emph{reachable}
  if there exist a $k$ and a particular sequence of temperature
  $T_{1, k}=T_1, \dots, T_k$ such that the ratio of the performance metric to the
  target biomass, $m_0$, is less than a tolerance value, $\epsilon$.
$$
\frac{\sqrt{L(T_{1, k}, m_0, t_f)}}{m_0} < \epsilon
$$
\end{definition}
In the following we will assume that a specific sequence of temperatures that
satisfies our tolerance, $\epsilon$, exists if the particular optimisation
algorithm we use can converge to that sequence.

Figure~\ref{fig:directPRes} shows results of the optimisation procedure for both
the biomass-only and biomass+control effort problems defined in the previous
section for a range of target biomasses. For the biomass-only problem there is a
set of reachable target biomasses $[0.03, 0.25]$ (Figure~\ref{fig:directPRes}A)
for a tolerance $\epsilon=0.1$ , $k=4$, and $t_f=512$h. The upper and lower
bound constraints for the temperature values are set to 10 \textdegree C and 30
\textdegree C respectively. The optimisation converges to different solutions on
different runs (Figure~\ref{fig:directPRes}B and C, D, E for details of
particular solutions for $m_0=0.05$, $m_0=0.1$, and $m_0=0.15$ respectively). It
is also interesting to explore if the optimisation increases the reachable set
compared to a naive exhaustive simulation of the FM with constant temperature
inputs in the constrained space [10 \textdegree C, 30 \textdegree C]. Exhaustive
simulation of the FM in the space [10 \textdegree C, 30 \textdegree C] with a
$0.5$ \textdegree C step gives final (at $t_f=512$h) biomasses between $0.0093$g
at 10 \textdegree C and $0.1806$g at 17.5 \textdegree C while more than one
temperature input can give the same (or very close) final biomass (orange line,
Figure~\ref{fig:directPRes}B).

    formulation.}
\label{fig:directPRes}
\end{figure}

For the biomass+control effort problem we find a smaller reachable set
$[0.03, 0.21]$ compared to the biomass-only problem
(Figure~\ref{fig:directPRes}F) with the same parameters. The optimisation
procedure though in this case mostly converges to the same solution at different
runs and the solutions mostly keep the temperature constant
(Figure~\ref{fig:directPRes}F and H, I, J for details of particular solutions
for $m_0=0.05$, $m_0=0.1$, and $m_0=0.15$ respectively). Comparing the solutions
to the naive exhaustive search as before we can see the optimisation converges
to constant temperature solutions that are very close to the ones given by the
simulation with a similar reachable set. In cases where two constant temperature
inputs give the same final biomass the optimisation cannot distinguish between
the two and can converge to either (for example, Figure~\ref{fig:directPRes}H
and temperature distributions in G).

Finally, we can compare the results of the optimal strategy with a random
strategy (as a control) where the sequence of temperatures, $T_1, \dots, T_k$ is
picked at random (Figure~\ref{fig:compsAllDir}). For 100 simulation runs for
both optimal and random strategies, the optimal strategy performs significantly
better for target biomasses $m_0=0.05$ and $m_0=0.1$.

  the random strategy where temperatures are chosen at random for the 4
  intervals.

\section{Growth space inhomogeneities experiment}
\label{sec:exp}
We have so far assumed that we can perfectly control the environmental
conditions inside the growth chamber such that all the plants are exposed to the
same temperature. In actual growth spaces, this is rarely possible. To quantify
the effect of temperature inhomogeneity on plant growth we conducted an
experiment designed to test the difference in growth (biomass) of two sets of
\textit{Arabidopsis thaliana} plants grown in two different locations on a shelf
(Figure~\ref{fig:expRes}E). The first group of plants is grown in the middle of
the shelf and the second on the side of the shelf.

% In the direct problem
% formulation and the entire premise of this work we have the assumption that we
% can perfectly control the environmental conditions inside the growth space such
% that all the growing plants can grow in perfectly homogeneous conditions. Based
% on our experience of growing plants in academic growth spaces, which are
% specifically designed to reduced experimental technical variability, this
% assumptions is rarely true. To test this we conducted an experiment in a growth
% room designed to test the difference in growth (biomass) of two sets of
% \textit{Arabidopsis thaliana} plants grown in two different locations on a shelf
% (Figure~\ref{fig:expRes}E) in a typical growth room. The first group of plants
% is grown in the middle of the shelf and the second on the side of the shelf.

\begin{figure}[tb]

\label{fig:expRes}
\end{figure}

The environmental conditions in terms of light and temperature are very
different between the two sets of plants (Figure~\ref{fig:expRes}C, D). We took
two samples at two different stages of vegetative development and before
bolting, one at 23 days after germination (plants M1/1[1-6], M2/2[1-6] for the
middle group and plants S1/1[1-6], S2/2[1-6] for the side group --
Figure~\ref{fig:expRes}) and one 27 days after germination (plants M1/2[1-6],
M2/1[1-6] for the middle group and plants S1/2[1-6], S2/1[1-6] for the side
group -- Figure~\ref{fig:expRes}). The differences in the environmental
conditions affected the growth and resulted in differences in biomass of the two
groups (Figure~\ref{fig:expRes}A, B). While the differences in biomass is not
statistically significant in the 23-day sample, in the 27-day sample the
difference in biomass between the two groups is significant. The environmental
differences are amplified during the exponential growth of the plants.


\section{Indirect problem}
In the direct problem formulation we assumed perfect control inside the growth
space of a crop such that the temperature is homogeneous and all the plants are
exposed to the same conditions. This is rarely true even in academic growth
environments (see previous section, for example). Here we address the problem of
controlling plant growth acting on the position of plants in a linear array: a
linear temperature gradient is imposed on such an array. As in this case we can
only change the temperature the plant is growing indirectly, \ie by changing its
position in the linear array, we call this problem ``indirect''. This
formulation more closely resembles industrially relevant problems.

% In the direct problem formulation we assumed perfect control inside the growth
% space of a crop such that the temperature is homogeneous and all the plants are
% exposed to the same conditions. Despite progress in the technology of growth
% chambers this assumption is rarely true even in academic growth environments
% (see previous section, for example). This is problematic because it means growth
% inhomogeneities along the population. We therefore turn into a related problem
% where we try to reduce as much as possible temperature and therefore growth
% inhomogeneities in a population of plants by controlling their positions in a
% growth space during development. This, again, could be relevant for growers
% where there are requirements for homogeneity or even in academic settings where
% technical variability is expected to be minimal.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/indirectPFig/indirectOC.eps}
\caption{Indirect problem of climate control. In the \emph{indirect problem} we
  try to find a position function (map from time and plant id to position in a
  linear array) such that the final biomasses of the plants as predicted by the
  FM (using the position dependent temperature of the plants as input) to be as
  close to each other as possible (minimum Gini-index).}
\label{fig:indirectP}
\end{figure}

We assume that have $n$ plants and the growth space is a linear array of $n$
positions such that each plant occupies one position. We further assume that we
are given a global temperature perhaps coming from an optimisation procedure
(for example, see the direct problem before) but due to non-precise control this
gives rise to a temperature gradient along the array where the plants are
positioned. The optimal control problem becomes then to find an optimal position
function $P^*(i, t)$ that gives the position of plant $i$ at time $t$ over a
period $[t_0, t_f]$ such that some non-uniformity index over the final biomasses
of the $n$ plants is minimised:
$$
J = G(m_1(t_f), \dots, m_n(t_f))
$$
Here we write $m_i(t_f)$ for the biomass of $i$-th plant at the final time $t_f$
and we use the Gini index (denoted by $G$) as our non-uniformity metric.

As in the case of the direct problem we can turn the above into an optimisation
problem by discretising the time domain $[t_0, t_f]$ into $k$ intervals and
assuming that the positions of the plants are constant inside each interval. Our
objective is to obtain by $t_f$ a set of plants with similar (satisfactory)
biomass. The problem then becomes to find the a sequence of $n \cdot k$ values,
$$
P = \begin{bmatrix} 
    p_{11} & p_{12} & \dots \\
    \vdots & \ddots & \\
    p_{n1} &        & p_{nk} 
    \end{bmatrix}
$$
,where $p_{i, j}$, is the position of plant $j$ at interval $i$:
\begin{align*}
& \min_{P} \; G(m_1(t_f), \dots, m_n(t_f)) \; \text{subject to} \\
& 1 < p_{ij} < n \\
& p_{ij} \; \text{integers}
\end{align*}

The positioning of the plant indirectly determines the temperature function,
$T(t)$, over $[t_0, t_f]$ for the plants. Unlike the direct problem the decision
variables of the optimisation problem are discrete. We therefore cannot use
standard gradient-based optimisation techniques. In the results in the following
sections we use a technique from combinatorial optimisation (see next section)
that uses some heuristics to search the space of all solutions while following
our objective function from above.

A constraint that we have overlooked in the formulation above is the need to
have one plant, and only one, in each position at every single time point. We
can formalise this as: for any interval $j$ all the values in the sequence
$p_{1j}, \dots, p_{nj}$ should be unique. In order to not have to deal with this
extra constraint we make a change to the formulation of the problem such that
the solutions of the combinatorial optimisation procedure are guaranteed to
satisfy this ``non-overlap constraint'' without having the constraint explicitly
in the optimisation procedure. In particular suppose that we have a permutation
matrix, $\Pi(n)$, that lists all the possible permutation of $n$ numbers:

$$
\Pi = \begin{bmatrix} 
    1 & 2 & 3 & \dots n \\
    2 & 1 & 3 & \dots n \\
    \vdots &  & \vdots \\
    n &  n-1 & \dots  &  1 \\
    \end{bmatrix}
$$
We redefine the optimisation with the decision variables being indices into the
permutation matrix so for example if at interval $j$ one we get $\pi_j$ then we
have the positions of each plant, $i$, at that interval $P_{ij} = \Pi_{(\pi_j, i)}$

\begin{definition}[permutation-index problem]
The \emph{permutation-index problem} is a variant of the indirect problem of
climate control where we seek a sequence of values $\pi_1, \dots \pi_k$ that minimise the
inhomogeneity in the final biomasses (after $t_f$ hours, as predicted by the FM)
of $n$ plants.
\begin{align*}
& \min_{\pi_1, \dots \pi_k} \; G(m_1(t_f), \dots, m_n(t_f)) \; \text{subject to} \\
& 1 < \pi_i < n! \\
& \pi_i \; \text{integers}
\end{align*}
\end{definition}

The number of all possible permutations for $n$ numbers is given by $n!$. The
order of permutations in $\Pi$ is important here as we need to make sure that
solutions that are close together in the permutation index space are also close
together in the positions space. Here we assume that every permutation listed in
$\Pi$ is one flip away from the permutation above it. Therefore consecutive
points in permutation space are adjacent in position space as well. For the
instances of the problems we dealt with this solution was adequate. However, for
larger instances the search space might become prohibitively large ($n!$) in
which case we can go back to the previous formulation of the problem and
introduce an overlap penalty in the objective function.

\subsection{Results} 
In this section we explore solutions to the permutation-index problem defined in
the previous section using combinatorial optimisation techniques. In particular
we use a Matlab implementation \citep[MEIGO too;][]{banga2014} of the Variable
Neighbourhood Search algorithm \citep[VNS;][]{mladenovic1997variable}.

For the following experiment described in this section we assumed a growth space
of $5$ position with $5$ growing plants, one for each position, $k=4$ intervals
and $t_f=512$ hours. The temperature gradient goes from 20 \textdegree C at
position 1 on one end of the growth array to 24 \textdegree C at position $5$ at
the other end of the array. The positions in between are assumed have a
temperature linearly interpolated between the values at the two ends of the
array. We use a normalised performance metric $\tilde{G}=G/G_s$ where $G_s$ is
the value of the Gini-index for a position matrix where the positions of the
plants are unchanged over the growth period.

Unsurprisingly the optimisation procedure returns results where the plant
positions are shuffled over the time intervals (example solutions:
Figure~\ref{fig:compsAllInDir}A). The optimal strategy is significantly better
though than a naive strategy where the plants are randomly assigned positions at
each interval (Figure~\ref{fig:compsAllInDir}B). Both strategies are better over
100 runs than the static strategies where the plant positions are unchanged in
the growing period (static $G$ value indicated by dotted line,
Figure~\ref{fig:compsAllInDir}B).


\section{Discussion}
We present a formulation of the climate control problem for achieving particular
growth-related plant (or population of plants) attributes as an optimal control
problem and solution after transforming it to an optimisation problem. Optimal
control of climate in greenhouses has been studied for a long time but since
greenhouses are not insulated to weather conditions, greater effort (and
therefore energy) is needed for climate control. Optimal control studies have
therefore mainly been focused on reducing energy consumption \citep{fisher1997,
ramirezArias2012, delSagrado2016} with very few also taking into account plant
processes like photosynthesis for optimising growth as well as energy
consumption\citep{harun2015, Aaslyng2003}. Here we assume that our growth space
is more insulated so that more precise control is available at less effort. This
allows us to focus on crop traits and even at more precise quality control
standards like size and uniformity. We do, however, consider a control effort
quantity in the biomass+control effort problem formulation of the direct problem
that should be related to energy consumption. In the indirect problem we do not
have that even though switching the plant positions will require significant
energy even at sophisticated growth environments.  %related work

%discussion of results
In order to address the climate control problem we start with a \emph{direct
problem} where we try to find an optimal input temperature signal to the FM so
that the output biomass signal has a particular value at some final time,
$t_f$. The formulation of the problem with an added penalty for control effort
along with exhaustive simulations with constant temperature inputs suggest that
a single constant temperature input is almost enough to achieve the same results
as the optimal strategy (Figure~\ref{fig:directPRes}A, B, F, G). There is very
little increase in the controllable range using the optimal strategy as opposed
to naive enumeration of the single temperature-final biomass map using
simulation of the FM (Figure~\ref{fig:directPRes}B, G).  %tomato result optimal
temperature, find paper As we have seen from experimental results though even if
we set a global optimal temperature (for example as given by a solution of an
optimisation problem representing the direct problem) we are not guaranteed that
all the plants will have the same conditions. Distances as little as 1m (same
shelf), even in spaces designed specifically to reduce climate inhomogeneities,
can lead to significant environmental and therefore growth differences among a
population of plants. We therefore turned to a formulation of an \emph{indirect
problem} of climate control where we accept the inhomogeneities and try to
minimise them (and therefore also growth inhomogeneities) by switching the
positions of plants along a space with a temperature gradient.

%limitations -- model
For the solutions of both problem statements, direct and indirect, we use the FM
as our ground truth to predict plant behaviour at different temperature input
profiles. The FM starts with biochemical models that have been validated only in
a narrow range of experimentally relevant temperatures so even in our seemingly
conservative temperature range ([10\textdegree C, 30 \textdegree C]) there might
be gaps in our understanding \citep{walker_temperature_2013}. This limits the
predictive power of the model across the range that we consider. Moreover there
might be other temperature effects on plant physiology that we do not
consider. The FM is deterministic but often there is variability in growth,
which might suggest an adaptive strategy in a possible implementation with a
continuous monitoring of the growing plants.

%conclusion + future
Our approach builds on ideas from traditional climate control in greenhouses and
the availability of more sophisticated growth spaces to suggest using optimal
control of climate for control of crop traits and quality standards, like size
and uniformity. Of course while the application of such methods is most
interesting for crop species that are practically relevant, here we chose the
model species \textit{Arabidopsis thaliana}. It will be interesting first to
test our offline in-silico optimisation experiments in an actual prototype
implementation for Arabidopsis plants given the limitations of the model-only
approach outlined above. Application of such techniques for more practically
relevant crops will also be very attractive and there is a number of models to
back such an application for commercial crops (potato models,
\cite{fleisher2017potato}; tomato model, \cite{heuvelink1999evaluation}; wheat
models, \cite{martre2015multimodel}). Finally, another possible application of,
for example, the indirect problem formulation might be in academic settings
where technical variability is expected to be minimal and there is an increase
in the use of automated phenotyping and growth platforms (PHENOPSIS
\cite{granier_phenopsis_2006}; platforms in the European Plant Phenotyping
Network, \url{https://eppn2020.plant-phenotyping.eu/}).
