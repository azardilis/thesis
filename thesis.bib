  abstract	= {A reaction network is a chemical system involving multiple
		  reactions and chemical species. The simplest stochastic
		  models of such networks treat the system as a continuous
		  time Markov chain with the state being the number of
		  molecules of each species and with reactions modeled as
		  possible transitions of the chain. This chapter is devoted
		  to the mathematical study of such stochastic models. We
		  begin by developing much of the mathematical machinery we
		  need to describe the stochastic models we are most
		  interested in. We show how one can represent counting
		  processes of the type we need in terms of Poisson
		  processes. This random time-change representation gives a
		  stochastic equation for continuous-time Markov chain
		  models. We include a discussion on the relationship between
		  this stochastic equation and the corresponding martingale
		  problem and Kolmogorov forward (master) equation. Next, we
		  exploit the representation of the stochastic equation for
		  chemical reaction networks and, under what we will refer to
		  as the classical scaling, show how to derive the
		  deterministic law of mass action from the Markov chain
		  model. We also review the diffusion, or Langevin,
		  approximation, include a discussion of first order reaction
		  networks, and present a large class of networks, those that
		  are weakly reversible and have a deficiency of zero, that
		  induce product-form stationary distributions. Finally, we
		  discuss models in which the numbers of molecules and/or the
		  reaction rate constants of the system vary over several
		  orders of magnitude. We show that one consequence of this
		  wide variation in scales is that different subsystems may
		  evolve on different time scales and this time-scale
		  variation can be exploited to identify reduced models that
		  capture the behavior of parts of the system. We will
		  discuss systematic ways of identifying the different time
		  scales and deriving the reduced models.},

  abstract	= {Modelling in biology becomes necessary when systems are
		  complex but the more complex the systems are the harder the
		  models become to read. The most common ways of writing
		  models are by writing reactions on discrete, typed objects
		  (e.g. molecules of different species), or writing rate
		  equations for the populations of such species. One problem
		  (1) with those approaches is that the number of species and
		  reactions is often so large that the model cannot be
		  realistically enumerated. Another problem (2) is that the
		  number of species and reactions is fixed, whereas biology
		  often grows new compartments which means new reactions and
		  species. Here we develop an extension to the representation
		  of reactions where the objects carry variables that are
		  defined by their type (for example objects of type Leaf all
		  have a Mass variable). The dynamics are defined by rules
		  about types, which means they work for all objects of that
		  type. This compact representation solves problem 1. If we
		  think of the object variables as the analogue of
		  reaction/rate equation species, creating a new object of
		  some type means we are also creating new species (solving
		  problem 2). We also developed an embedding of Chromar in
		  the programming language Haskell and showed its
		  applicability to two examples. Having a more compact
		  representation can help make models a tool for knowledge
		  representation and exchange instead of just a simulation
		  input. Embedding Chromar in a general purpose programming
		  language lifts some of the constraints of modelling
		  languages while still maintaining the naturalness of a
		  domain-specific language.},

  abstract	= {Simulation of biomolecular networks is now indispensable
		  for studying biological systems, from small reaction
		  networks to large ensembles of cells. Here we present a
		  novel approach for stochastic simulation of networks
		  embedded in the dynamic environment of the cell and its
		  surroundings. We thus sample trajectories of the stochastic
		  process described by the chemical master equation with
		  time-varying propensities. A comparative analysis shows
		  that existing approaches can either fail dramatically, or
		  else can impose impractical computational burdens due to
		  numerical integration of reaction propensities, especially
		  when cell ensembles are studied. Here we introduce the
		  Extrande method which, given a simulated time course of
		  dynamic network inputs, provides a conditionally exact and
		  several orders-of-magnitude faster simulation solution. The
		  new approach makes it feasible to demonstrate—using
		  decision-making by a large population of quorum sensing
		  bacteria—that robustness to fluctuations from upstream
		  signaling places strong constraints on the design of
		  networks determining cell fate. Our approach has the
		  potential to significantly advance both understanding of
		  molecular systems biology and design of synthetic
		  circuits.},

  abstract	= {Functional Reactive Programming, or FRP, is a general
		  framework for programming hybrid systems in a high-level,
		  declarative manner. The key ideas in FRP are its notions of
		  behaviors and events. Behaviors are time-varying, reactive
		  values, while events are time-ordered sequences of
		  discrete-time event occurrences. FRP is the essence of
		  Fran, a domain-specific language embedded in Haskell for
		  programming reactive animations, but FRP is now also being
		  used in vision, robotics and other control systems
		  applications. In this paper we explore the formal semantics
		  of FRP and how it relates to an implementation based on
		  streams that represent (and therefore only approximate)
		  continuous behaviors. We show that, in the limit as the
		  sampling interval goes to zero, the implementation is
		  faithful to the formal, continuous semantics, but only when
		  certain constraints on behaviors are observed. We explore
		  the nature of these constraints, which vary amongst the FRP
		  primitives. Our results show both the power and limitations
		  of this approach to language design and implementation. As
		  an example of a limitation, we show that streams are
		  incapable of representing instantaneous predicate events
		  over behaviors.},

		  used to model, analyze, and visualize genetic circuits.
		  Many biological analysis tools flatten out hierarchy before
		  simulation, but there are many disadvantages associated
		  with this approach. First, the memory required to represent
		  the model can quickly expand in the process. Second, the
		  flattening process is computationally expensive. Finally,
		  when modeling a dynamic cellular population within iBioSim,
		  inlining the hierarchy of the model is inefficient since
		  models must grow dynamically over time. This paper
		  discusses a new approach to handle hierarchy on the fly to
		  make the tool faster and more memory-efficient. This
		  approach yields significant performance improvements as
		  compared to the former flat analysis method.},
