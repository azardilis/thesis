                  whole-organism physiology, analogous to mapping genotype to
                  phenotype, remains a key challenge in biology. Quantitative
                  models that represent processes at multiple scales and link
                  understanding from several research domains can help to tackle
                  this problem. Such integrated models are more common in crop
                  science and ecophysiology than in the research communities
                  that elucidate molecular networks. Several laboratories have
                  modeled particular aspects of growth in Arabidopsis thaliana,
                  but it was unclear whether these existing models could
                  productively be combined. We test this approach by
                  constructing a multiscale model of Arabidopsis rosette
                  growth. Four existing models were integrated with minimal
                  parameter modification (leaf water content and one flowering
                  parameter used measured data). The resulting framework model
                  links genetic regulation and biochemical dynamics to events at
                  the organ and whole-plant levels, helping to understand the
                  combined effects of endogenous and environmental regulators on
                  Arabidopsis growth. The framework model was validated and
                  tested with metabolic, physiological, and biomass data from
                  two laboratories, for five photoperiods, three accessions, and
                  a transgenic line, highlighting the plasticity of plant growth
                  strategies. The model was extended to include stochastic
                  development. Model simulations gave insight into the
                  developmental control of leaf production and provided a
                  quantitative explanation for the pleiotropic developmental
                  phenotype caused by overexpression of miR156, which was an
                  open question. Modular, multiscale models, assembling
                  knowledge from systems biology to ecophysiology, will help to
                  understand and to engineer plant behavior from the genome to
                  the field.},

  abstract	= {Functional Reactive Programming, or FRP, is a general
		  framework for programming hybrid systems in a high-level,
		  declarative manner. The key ideas in FRP are its notions of
		  behaviors and events. Behaviors are time-varying, reactive
		  values, while events are time-ordered sequences of
		  discrete-time event occurrences. FRP is the essence of
		  Fran, a domain-specific language embedded in Haskell for
		  programming reactive animations, but FRP is now also being
		  used in vision, robotics and other control systems

		  sampling interval goes to zero, the implementation is
		  faithful to the formal, continuous semantics, but only when
		  certain constraints on behaviors are observed. We explore
		  the nature of these constraints, which vary amongst the FRP
		  primitives. Our results show both the power and limitations
		  of this approach to language design and implementation. As
		  an example of a limitation, we show that streams are
		  incapable of representing instantaneous predicate events

  abstract	= {Modelling in biology becomes necessary when systems are
		  complex but the more complex the systems are the harder the
		  models become to read. The most common ways of writing
		  models are by writing reactions on discrete, typed objects
		  (e.g. molecules of different species), or writing rate
		  equations for the populations of such species. One problem
		  (1) with those approaches is that the number of species and
		  reactions is often so large that the model cannot be
		  realistically enumerated. Another problem (2) is that the
		  number of species and reactions is fixed, whereas biology
		  often grows new compartments which means new reactions and
		  species. Here we develop an extension to the representation
		  of reactions where the objects carry variables that are
		  defined by their type (for example objects of type Leaf all
		  have a Mass variable). The dynamics are defined by rules
		  about types, which means they work for all objects of that
		  type. This compact representation solves problem 1. If we
		  think of the object variables as the analogue of
		  reaction/rate equation species, creating a new object of
		  some type means we are also creating new species (solving
		  problem 2). We also developed an embedding of Chromar in
		  the programming language Haskell and showed its
		  applicability to two examples. Having a more compact
		  representation can help make models a tool for knowledge
		  representation and exchange instead of just a simulation
		  input. Embedding Chromar in a general purpose programming
		  language lifts some of the constraints of modelling
		  languages while still maintaining the naturalness of a
		  domain-specific language.},

  abstract	= {Mathematical biology has hitherto emphasized the
		  quantitative, metric aspects of the physical manifestations
		  of life, but has neglected the relational or positional
		  aspects, which are of paramount importance in biology.
		  Although, for example, the processes of locomotion,
		  ingestion, and digestion in a human are much more complex
		  than in a protozoan, the general relations between these
		  processes are the same in all organisms. To a set of very
		  complicated digestive functions of a higher animal there
		  correspond a few simple functions in a protozoan. In other
		  words, the more complicated processes in higher organisms
		  can be mapped on the simpler corresponding processes in the
		  lower ones. If any scientific study of this aspect of
		  biology is to be possible at all, there must exist some
		  regularity in such mappings. We are, therefore, led to the
		  following principle: If the relations between various
		  biological functions of an organism are represented
		  geometrically in an appropriate topological space or by an
		  appropriate topological complex, then the spaces or
		  complexes representing different organisms must be
		  obtainable by a proper transformation from one or very
		  fewprimordial spaces or complexes.The appropriate
		  representation of the relations between the different
		  biological functions of an organism appears to be a
		  one-dimensional complex, or graph, which represents the
		  “organization chart” of the organism. The problem then
		  is to find a proper transformation which derives from this
		  graph the graphs of all possible higher organisms. Both a
		  primordial graph and a transformation are suggested and
		  discussed. Theorems are derived which show that the basic
		  principle of mapping and the transformation have a
		  predictive value and are verifiable experimentally.These
		  considerations are extended to relations within animal and
		  human societies and thus indicate the reason for the
		  similarities between some aspects of societies and
		  organisms.It is finally suggested that the relation between
		  physics and biology may lie on a different plane from the
		  one hitherto considered. While physical phenomena are the
		  manifestations of the metric properties of the
		  four-dimensional universe, biological phenomena may perhaps
		  reflect some local topological properties of that

		  due to an instability of the homogeneous equilibrium, which
		  is triggered off by random disturbances. Such
		  reaction-diffusion systems are considered in some detail in
		  the case of an isolated ring of cells, a mathematically
		  convenient, though biologically unusual system. The
		  investigation is chiefly concerned with the onset of
		  instability. It is found that there are six essentially
		  different forms which this may take. In the most
		  interesting form stationary waves appear on the ring. It is
		  suggested that this might account, for instance, for the
		  tentacle patterns on Hydra and for whorled leaves. A system
		  of reactions and diffusion on a sphere is also considered.
		  Such a system appears to account for gastrulation. Another
		  reaction system in two dimensions gives rise to patterns

		  conclusions. However, at the molecular level, models are

		  not well understood. Here we consider three trade-offs
		  that, because of limitations in levels of cellular energy,
		  free ribosomes, and proteins, are faced by all living cells
		  and we construct a mechanistic model that comprises these
		  trade-offs. Our model couples gene expression with growth
		  rate and growth rate with a growing population of cells. We
		  show that the model recovers Monod’s law for the growth
		  of microbes and two other empirical relationships
		  connecting growth rate to the mass fraction of ribosomes.
		  Further, we can explain growth-related effects in dosage
		  compensation by paralogs and predict host–circuit
		  interactions in synthetic biology. Simulating competitions
		  between strains, we find that the regulation of metabolic
		  pathways may have evolved not to match expression of
		  enzymes to levels of extracellular substrates in changing
		  environments but rather to balance a trade-off between
		  exploiting one type of nutrient over another. Although
		  coarse-grained, the trade-offs that the model embodies are
		  fundamental, and, as such, our modeling framework has
		  potentially wide application, including in both
		  biotechnology and medicine.},

		  life-cycle variation for adaptation. In this study, we
		  examine genetic variation in traits covering the major life
		  history events of the annual species Arabidopsis thaliana:
		  seed dormancy, vegetative growth rate and flowering time.
		  In a sample of 112 genotypes collected throughout the
		  European range of the species, both seed dormancy and
		  flowering time follow a latitudinal gradient independent of
		  the major population structure gradient. This finding
		  confirms previous studies reporting the adaptive evolution
		  of these two traits. Here, however, we further analyze
		  patterns of co-variation among traits. We observe that
		  co-variation between primary dormancy, vegetative growth
		  rate and flowering time also follows a latitudinal cline.
		  At higher latitudes, vegetative growth rate is positively
		  correlated with primary dormancy and negatively with
		  flowering time. In the South, this trend disappears.
		  Patterns of trait co-variation change, presumably because
		  major environmental gradients shift with latitude. This
		  pattern appears unrelated to population structure,
		  suggesting that changes in the coordinated evolution of
		  major life history traits is adaptive. Our data suggest
		  that A. thaliana provides a good model for the evolution of
		  trade-offs and their genetic basis.},

		  reactions and chemical species. The simplest stochastic
		  models of such networks treat the system as a continuous
		  time Markov chain with the state being the number of
		  molecules of each species and with reactions modeled as
		  possible transitions of the chain. This chapter is devoted
		  to the mathematical study of such stochastic models. We
		  begin by developing much of the mathematical machinery we
		  need to describe the stochastic models we are most
		  interested in. We show how one can represent counting
		  processes of the type we need in terms of Poisson
		  processes. This random time-change representation gives a
		  stochastic equation for continuous-time Markov chain
		  models. We include a discussion on the relationship between
		  this stochastic equation and the corresponding martingale
		  problem and Kolmogorov forward (master) equation. Next, we
		  exploit the representation of the stochastic equation for
		  chemical reaction networks and, under what we will refer to
		  as the classical scaling, show how to derive the
		  deterministic law of mass action from the Markov chain
		  model. We also review the diffusion, or Langevin,
		  approximation, include a discussion of first order reaction
		  networks, and present a large class of networks, those that
		  are weakly reversible and have a deficiency of zero, that
		  induce product-form stationary distributions. Finally, we
		  discuss models in which the numbers of molecules and/or the
		  reaction rate constants of the system vary over several
		  orders of magnitude. We show that one consequence of this
		  wide variation in scales is that different subsystems may
		  evolve on different time scales and this time-scale
		  variation can be exploited to identify reduced models that
		  capture the behavior of parts of the system. We will
		  discuss systematic ways of identifying the different time
		  scales and deriving the reduced models.},

  abstract	= {Rule-based modelling is particularly effective for
		  handling the highly combinatorial aspects of cellular
		  signalling. The dynamics is described in terms of
		  interactions between partial complexes, and the ability to
		  write rules with such partial complexes -i.e., not to have
		  to specify all the traits of the entitities partaking in a
		  reaction but just those that matter- is the key to
		  obtaining compact descriptions of what otherwise could be
		  nearly infinite dimensional dynamical systems. This also
		  makes these descriptions easier to read, write and
		  modify.In the course of modelling a particular signalling
		  system it will often happen that more traits matter in a
		  given interaction than previously thought, and one will
		  need to strengthen the conditions under which that
		  interaction may happen. This is a process that we call rule
		  refinement and which we set out in this paper to study.
		  Specifically we present a method to refine rule sets in a
		  way that preserves the implied stochastic semantics.This
		  stochastic semantics is dictated by the number of different
		  ways in which a given rule can be applied to a system
		  (obeying the mass action principle). The refinement formula
		  we obtain explains how to refine rules and which choice of
		  refined rates will lead to a neutral refinement, i.e., one
		  that has the same global activity as the original rule had
		  (and therefore leaves the dynamics unchanged). It has a
		  pleasing mathematical simplicity, and is reusable with
		  little modification across many variants of stochastic
		  graph rewriting. A particular case of the above is the
		  derivation of a maximal refinement which is equivalent to a
		  (possibly infinite) Petri net and can be useful to get a
		  quick approximation of the dynamics and to calibrate
		  models. As we show with examples, refinement is also useful
		  to understand how different subpopulations contribute to
		  the activity of a rule, and to modulate differentially
		  their impact on that activity.},

		  describes the first model of Arabidopsis growth integrating

		  processes for aerial and subterranean parts of the plant
		  throughout its development. The objective was to analyse
		  competition among sinks as they emerge from patterns of
		  plant structural development. The model was adapted from
		  the GreenLab model and was used to estimate organ sink
		  strengths by optimisation against biomass measurements. Dry
		  biomass production was calculated by a radiation use
		  efficiency-based approach. Organogenesis processes were
		  parameterised based on experimental data. The potential of
		  this model for growth analysis was assessed using the
		  Columbia ecotype, which was grown in standard environmental
		  conditions. Three phases were observed in the overall time
		  course of trophic competition within the plant. In the
		  vegetative phase, no competition was observed. In the
		  reproductive phase, competition increased with a strong
		  increase when lateral inflorescences developed. Roots and
		  internodes and structures bearing siliques were strong
		  sinks and had a similar impact on competition. The

		  The mechanisms driving such global regulation, however, are
		  not well understood. Here we consider three trade-offs
		  that, because of limitations in levels of cellular energy,
		  free ribosomes, and proteins, are faced by all living cells
		  and we construct a mechanistic model that comprises these
		  trade-offs. Our model couples gene expression with growth
		  rate and growth rate with a growing population of cells. We
		  show that the model recovers Monod’s law for the growth
		  of microbes and two other empirical relationships
		  connecting growth rate to the mass fraction of ribosomes.
		  Further, we can explain growth-related effects in dosage
		  compensation by paralogs and predict host–circuit
		  interactions in synthetic biology. Simulating competitions
		  between strains, we find that the regulation of metabolic
		  pathways may have evolved not to match expression of
		  enzymes to levels of extracellular substrates in changing
		  environments but rather to balance a trade-off between
		  exploiting one type of nutrient over another. Although

		  shape this genetic variation, as well as the molecular

		  characterized the flowering behavior in relation to
		  vernalization of 182 A. thaliana wild genotypes collected

		  Phenotype-environment association analyses identified
		  strong altitudinal clines (0-2600 m) in seven out of nine

		  in terms of minimum winter temperature and precipitation
		  indicating that these are the main climatic factors that

		  four candidate genes, FRI, FLC, PhyC and CRY2, to decipher
		  the genetic bases of this variation. Eleven different
		  loss-of-function FRI alleles of low frequency accounted for
		  up to 16\% of the variation for most traits. Furthermore,
		  an FLC allelic series of six novel putative loss- and
		  change-of-function alleles, with low to moderate frequency,
		  revealed that a broader FLC functional diversification

		  environment-genotype association analyses showed that the
		  spatial patterns of FRI, FLC and PhyC polymorphisms are
		  significantly associated with winter temperatures and
		  spring and winter precipitations, respectively. These

  abstract	= {Reproductive phase change in Arabidopsis thaliana is
		  characterized by the floral transition (initiation of the
		  first flower) and the bolting transition (elongation of the
		  first internode). Here, the relationship between these
		  transitions is examined by comparing variation in cauline
		  and total leaf numbers in wild-type plants and 49
		  early-flowering mutants under a wide range of photoperiods.
		  The timing of these transitions was also evaluated by
		  subjecting wild-type plants to photoperiodic perturbations
		  at different developmental stages. Coupling between the
		  bolting and floral transitions was altered in the wild type
		  under non-optimal flowering conditions but could be
		  restored by optimal conditions that activate the
		  progression to flowering, including continuous light
		  treatments and early flowering mutations. Under non-optimal
		  photoperiodic conditions, the floral node was specified a
		  few days before the bolting node. Altered definitions of
		  long days for the cauline and total leaf responses were
		  frequently coupled in early flowering mutants and were
		  associated with similar photomorphogenetic defects. By
		  contrast, altered definitions of short days were often
		  opposite for the two leaf responses and were associated
		  with different photomorphogenetic and circadian phenotypes.
		  It is concluded that the bolting and floral transitions are
		  regulated by different signalling pathways under
		  non-optimal conditions and that phase change is a
		  multidimensional process. This paper also proposes that, in
		  contrast to the floral transition which is contingent on
		  different factors, the bolting transition may be a robust
		  indicator of reproductive phase change, especially when the
		  progression to flowering is not optimal.},

		  faithful to the formal, continuous semantics, but only when

		  the nature of these constraints, which vary amongst the FRP
		  primitives. Our results show both the power and limitations

		  of physical systems where models are expressed in terms of
		  non-causal differential-algebraic equations; i.e., sets of
		  constraints solved through numerical simulation. What
		  distinguishes our language is that the equational
		  constraints are first class entities allowing for an
		  evolving model structure characterised by repeated

		  staged. Our DSL can thus be seen as a combined functional
		  and constraint programming language, albeit a two-level
		  one, with the functional language chiefly serving as a meta
		  language. However, the two levels do interact throughout
		  the simulation. The embedding strategy we pursue is a
		  mixture of deep and shallow, with the deep embedding
		  enabling just-in-time (JIT) compilation of the constraints
		  as they are generated for efficiency, while the shallow
		  embedding is used for the remainder for maximum leverage of
		  the host language. The paper is organised around a specific
		  DSL, but our implementation strategy should be applicable
		  for iteratively staged languages in general. Our DSL itself
		  is further a novel variation of a declarative constraint

  abstract =	 {Declarative modeling uses symbolic expressions to represent
                  models. With such expressions one can formalize high-level
                  mathematical computations on models that would be difficult or
                  impossible to perform directly on a lower-level simulation
                  program, in a general-purpose programming language. Examples
                  of such computations on models include model analysis,
                  relatively general-purpose model-reduction maps, and the
                  initial phases of model implementation, all of which should
                  preserve or approximate the mathematical semantics of a
                  complex biological model. Multiscale modeling benefits from
                  both the expressive power of declarative modeling languages
                  and the application of model reduction methods to link models
                  across scale. Based on previous work, here we define
                  declarative modeling of complex biological systems by defining
                  the semantics of an increasingly powerful series of
                  declarative modeling languages including reaction-like
                  dynamics of parameterized and extended objects, we define
                  semantics-preserving implementation and
                  semantics-approximating model reduction transformations, and
                  we outline a "meta-hierarchy" for organizing declarative
                  models and the mathematical methods that can fruitfully
                  manipulate them.},

  abstract =	 {In applications dealing with plant growth modeling, increasing
                  attention is being devoted to the topological structure of
                  plants. Different models, based on tree-graphs, have been
                  introduced to represent plants. These models assume that the
                  scale of description is fixed. However, this hypothesis is too
                  restrictive for new modeling applications that aim to tackle
                  analysis or simulation of plant growth at different time and
                  space scales. In order to make such multiscale descriptions
                  available to computer applications, we have defined a general
                  methodology for measuring and representing multiscale plant
                  topological structures. This paper discusses the design of a
                  model of plant topological structures and sketches out its
                  general formal properties. The model supports multiscale,
                  attributed and time-varying descriptions of plants. It is

  abstract =	 {The development of functional–structural plant models requires
                  an increasing amount of computer modelling. All these models
                  are developed by different teams in various contexts and with
                  different goals. Efficient and flexible computational
                  frameworks are required to augment the interaction between
                  these models, their reusability, and the possibility to
                  compare them on identical datasets. In this paper, we present
                  an open-source platform, OpenAlea, that provides a
                  user-friendly environment for modellers, and advanced
                  deployment methods. OpenAlea allows researchers to build
                  models using a visual programming interface and provides a set
                  of tools and models dedicated to plant modelling. Models and
                  algorithms are embedded in OpenAlea ‘components’ with well
                  defined input and output interfaces that can be easily
                  interconnected to form more complex models and define more
                  macroscopic components. The system architecture is based on
                  the use of a general purpose, high-level, object-oriented
                  script language, Python, widely used in other scientific
                  areas. We present a brief rationale that underlies the
                  architectural design of this system and we illustrate the use
                  of the platform to assemble several heterogeneous model
                  components and to rapidly prototype a complex modelling
                  scenario.},

  abstract =	 {We study the problem of efficient maintenance of materialized
                  views that may contain duplicates. This problem is
                  particularly important when queries against such views involve
                  aggregate functions, which need duplicates to produce correct
                  results. Unlike most work on the view maintenance problem that
                  is based on an algorithmic approach, our approach is algebraic
                  and based on equational reasoning. This approach has a number
                  of advantages: it is robust and easily extendible to new
                  language constructs, it produces output that can be used by
                  query optimizers, and it simplifies correctness proofs.We use
                  a natural extension of the relational algebra operations to
                  bags (multisets) as our basic language. We present an
                  algorithm that propagates changes from base relations to
                  materialized views. This algorithm is based on reasoning about
                  equivalence of bag-valued expressions. We prove that it is
                  correct and preserves a certain notion of minimality that
                  ensures that no unnecessary tuples are computed. Although it
                  is generally only a heuristic that computing changes to the
                  view rather than recomputing the view from scratch is more
                  efficient, we prove results saying that under normal
                  circumstances one should expect, the change propagation
                  algorithm to be significantly faster and more space efficient
                  than complete recomputing of the view. We also show that our
                  approach interacts nicely with aggregate functions, allowing
                  their correct evaluation on views that change.},

                  behavior of individual agents. In our approach, a query

  abstract =	 {We describe a new platform for system dynamics modeling that
                  supports detailed and object oriented modeling while
                  preserving attractive features of existing tools, including a
                  completely declarative language with a graphical
                  representation. New concepts supporting this platform include
                  collections of entities, attributes, relationships,
                  aggregation and allocation functions, and actions, which are
                  presented with examples. The design facilitates modularity and
                  collaboration, provides a more natural description of detail
                  than arrays, and solves sparse matrix problems. It has
                  application to both traditional system dynamics, with modular
                  sectors, and to agent based modeling.},
