\chapter{Conclusions}
After a brief summary of the work presented in this thesis, we next go
through and dicuss each aspect of our work in the context we have set above to
understand its limitations, implications that follow, and possible future work
that it suggests.

\section{Summary}
% summary
No complex system can be understood by extrapolation of the properties of its
elementary components. In order to understand a complex system, like an
organism, one needs to consider explanations at various levels of detail. This
is especially true in biological systems where entities (processes and so on)
and their organisation give rise to properties of processes at the next level of
detail and they in turn to the next until you get to the level of a living
entity, the organism. In order to understand the organism (and consequently
life) we therefore need to understand the links between the explanations at the
various levels of detail.

The importance of organisation between components has been stressed before and
it is in fact the fundamental concept of systems theory. While the focus in
Biology has been traditionally on single components the systems view has found
its way into mainstream biological thinking with the systems biology
movement. The stress on organisation and its constructive nature also leads to
questions about representation. The most widely used technical languages for the
representation of physical systems come from the dynamics world. Since the
questions there are usually different, abstracting a system to its properties
through variables and ignoring organisation is usually adequate. The
constructive organisation of biological systems though poses different
requirements although the value of abstraction still remains. We present
\emph{Chromar} a language that combine organisational aspects through the
explicit representation of discrete entities, agents, and non-organisational
aspects through abstract properties of these entities, attributes. The concept
of abstraction is there in extensions to the expression language used for the
dynamics of the attributes. Observables recognise the need for explanations at
different levels by allowing an explicit functional link between abstract
quantifiable properties and more explicit representations. Fluents, again, allow
abstraction via the description of system properties using time-dependent
deterministic value for describing parts of the system we do not wish to model
mechanistically.

In plant research the focus has always been on the model species
Arabidopsis. Functional-structural models have focused on the constructive
organisation of plant organs (development) as well as functional aspects like
metabolism. The Framework Model is inspired by these but adds more breadth by
explicitly including a genetic circuit and phenology models to time the
conceptual development towards flowering. The FM covers one part of plant
development but does not extend to reproduction, which means that it has limited
applicability in ecological studies. Ecological studies on the other hand
consider the full lifecycle but of an abstract version of plants where its
construction and physical development are absent. We presented \emph{FM-life}
an extension to the FM to the full lifecycle including reproduction and its
scale-up to the population level via a clustering approoach to tractable
simulate population of plants over multiple decades in different genotype x
environment scenarios.

Finally, we presented another more engineering oriented use of multi-scale plant
model as devices for optimising plant traits. Instead of the more traditional
genome engineering approach we focused on engineering the environment during
their development to achieve specific growth-related traits.


\section{Chromar and representations of multi-scale biology}
Biology is modular. This includes "visibly" differentiated substructures like
the cell or organs, for example, given in spatial terms but also other entities
that form units in a non-spatial way that could be identified by the strength of
the interactions between their components or their functional goal. For example,
one might identify functional units in reaction networks
\citep{ederer_approach_2003} and hierarchical modules in metabolic networks
\citep{ravasz_hierarchical_2002}. These modules are organised either by
interaction -- more so the case in non-spatial modules -- or by physical forces
-- more the case in spatially distinguished modules like cells
\citep['Biological and Physical systems' section]{simon1962architecture}.

As we have pointed out, in order to understand complex biological systems, like
entire organisms, we need explanations at multiple levels of detail. At each
level of detail we can identify different modules, which can either be treated
as undivided wholes or as organisations of their elementary components/modules
\citep{varela_autopoiesis:_1974}. The links between the functioning of modules
at different levels of detail are crucial for fundamental questions in
Biology. We will call these aspects of biology that deal with modules, their
organisation (interaction), and hierarchy as the \emph{organisational} aspects
of systems. Importantly this organisation is constructive (dynamic).

Explicitly representing these links in organisational terms in detail, however,
is probably impractical in many cases. Even when considering the elementary
components of a module and their organisation, certain aspects of the
functioning of a module are still more practically captured through some
abstraction to pick out properties of interest that perhaps are important for
the links to the next level of detail. The abstraction that one uses to
understand the functioning of a module will depend on the level of understanding
and practical considerations. For example, we might not want to describe the
mechanism of a particular process ('how') but only 'what' it does at a more
descriptive level.  We will call these the \emph{non-organisational} or
\emph{abstract} aspects of a system (or its model).

Given that in multi-scale explanations of systems require representation of both
non-organisational and organisational aspects, the question of the technical
language used for this representation is interesting. For the organisational
parts since we are considering discrete entities, we need collections of objects
\citep{fontana_barrier_1996}. Other aspects of the organisation possibly also
then need the description of relations on these collections of objects
\citep{rashevsky_topology_1954, rosen_relational_1958}. The constructive nature
of this organisation means that we need a way to describe the
creation/destruction of objects and the creation or deletion of pairings of
objects in the defined relations. In Chromar we have simple representations of
organisational aspects where objects, agents, can be defined along with their
creation/destruction. Explicit definition of relations is not possible but we
have seen that different kinds of relations on objects exist in object-based
languages (Section~\ref{sec:objectLangs}). Implicit representation is possible
through agent attributes.

For the non-organisational aspect the question of representation is more
difficult since the point of abstrction is to use the most convenient or
practical explanation for a particular module. Chromar allows agents (modules)
to have attributes, which are lists of typed values. While attributed objects
(colours and so on) have been used in languages before, in Chromar these take an
`elevated' status where they could stand for entire models. Their dynamics come with
discrete transitions, which is the same way the dynamics of objects
(deletion/creation) are defined. This is very general and could satisfy a range
of applications and we have seen that the Dynamical Grammars of
\citet{mjolsness2006stochastic} also allow the description in terms of the more
familiar ODEs. 

What if we wanted to use the most convenient abstraction for the abstract parts
of each module though? Pragmatic approaches like multi-model simulators
\citep{erbm_mois_2015,cis_2018} allow that through concurrent running of
executables representing the simulation of each module. The organisation of the
modules, for example variable communication, is usually represented externally
in a configuration file. While this achieves the goal of simulation, the
resulting multi-model does not achieve the second goal of models that we have
identified regarding understanding since the organisation is opaque.

  \caption{A hypothetical system inspired by Chromar that combines
    non-organisational and organisational descriptions. Chromar gives us a clue
    of how these aspects can be combined with enriched expression. Unlike
    Chromar though we show here a system where relations are explicit and the
    dynamics can be expressed in the most relevant abstraction in each module
    (agent in Chromar).
    \label{fig:hyp}
\end{figure}

What the above suggest for possible future work is a system that handles both
the organisational aspects in an object-based language and the
non-organisational aspects possibly in many languages.

%Like Chromar we have discrete objects containing models (abstractions of its
%functioning but unlike chromar there is no restriction on the dynamics, these
%can be written in any language

synchronisation or the connections, interactions are defined using rules as is
already the case + other organisational aspects also handled by chromar like
construction rekations etc.



Since Chromar combines
the abstract with non-abstract spaces we recognised the need for a way to
connect the two views. This is done through enriched expressions that combine
attributes with observables that give functional links between abstract and more
detailed views and fluents that give another way for abstraction of functions
that we do not wish to characterise in organisational terms and rules. This is
crucial in a system like the one we point to especially if the modules are at
different levels and have both organisational and abstract views. One could
imagine for example making observables first-class and allowing them to be
attributes.

Consider for example the model in Figure~\ref{} expressed 
%synchronisation and more details

This perhaps reminds us of Rashevsky and godin
This will need mappings between calculi or more practically something like cis
or mois

Chromar already hints on how to combine the abstract and non-abstract spaces

%\subsection{Multi-scale models that combine}
% What does the Chromar experience suggest?
% Organisational aspects through Chromar or an object-based lang to capture either
% things that we consider objects or abstract objects like processes (see
% Barabasi)
% The non-organisational aspects can be captured in any relevant abstraction
% depending on the level of understanding Can be even treated as undivided wholes
% if needed

% Practically will need either mappings between formalisms or more pragmatically
% something like mois cis\_interface

% mois cis etc. combination of models is not a model!!


\subsection{Practical considerations}
None of these are important if people cannot use these things
Given the above library of models with

effect of one mechanism on context? This theme is also important for the
previous section, abstract then mechanisms can be added later. It might be
interesting to see if we understand the effects of a single mechanism on
higher-levels of organisation.
Not always at the mechanism level -- see Marr's levels

Since we're plant biologist and the plant is where we have mechanims information
we would like to see the effect on ecology and a plant centred

With phenology we kind of understand at hte first level of understanding, going
to the second level of mechanism or of how this is realised we need the organism
