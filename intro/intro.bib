                  relations between various components of biological functions
                  of the organism. Actually an organism is represented by a set
                  of differentn-ary relations. The present paper is an attempt
                  to outline a possible approach to this more realistic
                  situation. Inasmuch asn-ary relation is ann-place predicate,
                  it is attempted to describe the basic known properties of an
                  organism in terms ofn-place predicates, in which the variables
                  represent the different “components” of the organism. Some
                  possible forms of such predicates are discussed and some
                  general properties of systems of such predicates are
                  studied. It is shown that if the organism is described by
                  predicates of the type discussed here, statements can be
                  derived about the conditions “of reestablishability” of
                  different components. Conclusions similar to those obtained
                  previously by R. Rosen are reached now on a very different
                  basis. A description of the process of cell differentiation in
                  multicellular organisms in terms of predicates studied here is
                  briefly outlined. A comparison of similarities and differences

                  some of tis properties developed. An attempt is then made to
                  apply these properties to a theory of metabolism by suitable
                  specialization. A number of biologically significant theorems
                  are obtained which apply directly to the theory of the

                  following: On the basis of our model, there must always exist

                  by the system in the event of its inhibition or

	abstract = {Mathematical biology has hitherto emphasized the
                  quantitative, metric aspects of the physical manifestations of
                  life, but has neglected the relational or positional aspects,
                  which are of paramount importance in biology. Although, for
                  example, the processes of locomotion, ingestion, and digestion
                  in a human are much more complex than in a protozoan, the
                  general relations between these processes are the same in all
                  organisms. To a set of very complicated digestive functions of
                  a higher animal there correspond a few simple functions in a
                  protozoan. In other words, the more complicated processes in
                  higher organisms can be mapped on the simpler corresponding
                  processes in the lower ones. If any scientific study of this
                  aspect of biology is to be possible at all, there must exist
                  some regularity in such mappings. We are, therefore, led to
                  the following principle: If the relations between various
                  biological functions of an organism are represented
                  geometrically in an appropriate topological space or by an
                  appropriate topological complex, then the spaces or complexes
                  representing different organisms must be obtainable by a
                  proper transformation from one or very fewprimordial spaces or
                  complexes.The appropriate representation of the relations
                  between the different biological functions of an organism
                  appears to be a one-dimensional complex, or graph, which
                  represents the “organization chart” of the organism. The
                  problem then is to find a proper transformation which derives
                  from this graph the graphs of all possible higher
                  organisms. Both a primordial graph and a transformation are
                  suggested and discussed. Theorems are derived which show that
                  the basic principle of mapping and the transformation have a
                  predictive value and are verifiable experimentally.These
                  considerations are extended to relations within animal and
                  human societies and thus indicate the reason for the
                  similarities between some aspects of societies and
                  organisms.It is finally suggested that the relation between
                  physics and biology may lie on a different plane from the one
                  hitherto considered. While physical phenomena are the
                  manifestations of the metric properties of the
                  four-dimensional universe, biological phenomena may perhaps
                  reflect some local topological properties of that universe.},

	abstract = {It is suggested that a system of chemical substances, called
                  morphogens, reacting together and diffusing through a tissue,
                  is adequate to account for the main phenomena of
                  morphogenesis. Such a system, although it may originally be
                  quite homogeneous, may later develop a pattern or structure
                  due to an instability of the homogeneous equilibrium, which is
                  triggered off by random disturbances. Such reaction-diffusion
                  systems are considered in some detail in the case of an
                  isolated ring of cells, a mathematically convenient, though
                  biologically unusual system. The investigation is chiefly
                  concerned with the onset of instability. It is found that
                  there are six essentially different forms which this may
                  take. In the most interesting form stationary waves appear on
                  the ring. It is suggested that this might account, for
                  instance, for the tentacle patterns on Hydra and for whorled
                  leaves. A system of reactions and diffusion on a sphere is
                  also considered. Such a system appears to account for
                  gastrulation. Another reaction system in two dimensions gives
                  rise to patterns reminiscent of dappling. It is also suggested
                  that stationary waves in two dimensions could account for the
                  phenomena of phyllotaxis. The purpose of this paper is to
                  discuss a possible mechanism by which the genes of a zygote
                  may determine the anatomical structure of the resulting
                  organism. The theory does not make any new hypotheses; it
                  merely suggests that certain well-known physical laws are
                  sufficient to account for many of the facts. The full
                  understanding of the paper requires a good knowledge of
                  mathematics, some biology, and some elementary
                  chemistry. Since readers cannot be expected to be experts in
                  all of these subjects, a number of elementary facts are
                  explained, which can be found in text-books, but whose
                  omission would make the paper difficult reading.},
